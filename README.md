# Types of Email Templates
**Welcome Email:**
An email thanking the subscriber for subscribing. The email copy should introduce your brand and the call-to-action should prompt the subscriber to complete their profile or update their preferences.

**Newsletter Email:**
This periodic email educates and informs the subscribers about your brand and its products/services. Such emails should make your subscribers interested to make a purchase from your brand.

**Sale Promotion / Announcement Email:** 
The email that converts an email subscriber into a customer. This email will be purely marketing in tone and should make the subscriber believe that this purchase will solve the problem ‘get the job done’ that brought them to your brand in the first place.

**Order receipt Email:** 
An email to confirm the purchase made by the subscriber. This email should be triggered when a subscriber makes a purchase and can be used to promote other relevant products but the ratio needs to be 80% transactional and 20% promotional.

**Re-engagement Email:** Not all subscribers are going to stay active and keep opening your emails. This email will give a little nudge to such dormant subscribers and may bring them back to your sales cycle.

**(For ecommerce) Cart Abandonment Email:** 
Owing to many reasons, a well-nurtured subscriber may abandon their purchase mid-way. It is toxic to your business and this email will try to draw such abandoners back and re-unites them with their carts. A must-have email for ecommerce emails.

### Welcome Email: Modern, Pre-planned, Aesthetically Pleasing
This one will be completely thought out! that is the plant
